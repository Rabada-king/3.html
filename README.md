<h3>  INTRODUCTON       </h3>
	<p class="  xyz "> As a kid, I was always looking forward to holidays because holidays always meant some quality family time in the form of amazing trips to the most beautiful places all over the country.<br>
Among all these trips, till date, the one I remember the best was the trip I went on along with my parents to Darjeeling.<br>Darjeeling is a hill station situated in the state of West Bengal. It shares it border with Sikkim and also lies fairly close to foreign countries like Bhutan.<br>The city of Darjeeling had lasted since ancient times and was inhabited by indigenous communities, until it was colonised by the British for their own leisurely purposes.

<h3> Journey to Darjeeling</h3>
	<p id="mnop">  
	As there are certain difficulties in connecting a hilly area to the mainland using railways, direct trains to this city are rare and one instead has to take a train to the Siliguri station, mostly.

This and certain other such connecting areas serve as the link between tourists and the city of Darjeeling. If one wishes to take a flight, the nearest connecting airport is that of Bagdogra.<br>
Airplanes fly frequently between Bagdogra and Kolkata. In every sense, Darjeeling is a very well-connected city which in turn smoothly facilitates tourism and that too, in the most affordable of ways.<br>

Another major attraction of this city is the spectacular toy train.<br>

The ‘toy train’, or the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is an experience of a lifetime, and I was fortunate enough to have availed this rare mode of transportation while my visit to the city.<br>

This system runs from New Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling. The toy train places Darjeeling on the world map as it is a prestigious UNESCO world heritage site.<br>

The train runs on a narrow-gauge railway and was built way back in the nineteenth century (approximately between the years 1879 and 1881).<br>

The headquarters of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway lie in the beautiful town of <em>Kurseong.</em><br>

This line of toy trains is also classified as mountain railways and such railways are a rare occurrence not only in this country, but over the entire world.<br>

The successful survival of this railway proves how efficient the DHR administration is, and adds on conveniently to the attraction that this hill station is.<br>

While taking this train, one passes through a picturesque landscape, painted complete by clouds, hills, and the occasional appearance of the magnificent snow-clad peaks. The tunnels add on to the enigma of the journey.<br>

The local scenery is charming and quaint and is soothing to the eyes of urban dwellers like us.<br>

<strong>Such journeys really refresh one to their core as such sceneries are a pleasant change to the monotonous daily routines which bind us to our lifestyle.</strong><br>

	Darjeeling is a unique land of mountains, momos and pagodas- and this sentence does very little justice to the true diverse beauty this city really is.<br>

Some places of attraction at Darjeeling are the Tiger hill, the mall, the peace pagoda, and obviously, the snow peaks of Kanchenjunga (you cannot obviously visit them though).<br>

The town is also adorned by splendid waterfalls, horseback rides, cable cars, and numerous other things you possibly cannot find in any other spot of tourist attraction.<br>

Just a simple walk down the meandering lanes of the city is a treat to all of one’s senses at once, together.<br>

Furthermore, one early morning view out of the window on a lucky, non-clouded day can allow one to catch a fortunate glimpse of the snowy peak of the Kanchenjunga mountain (a part of the Himalayan range), which is certain to fill up one’s heart with aesthetic delight.<br>

The mall is a unique place of scenic beauty and local gathering which is also a noteworthy British contribution.<br>

The mall is lit up with bands playing, shops lined up featuring the local cuisines and attractions, horses offering rides <em>(well, obviously not on their own),</em> and the local communities strewn all over the place, illuminated with their cordial smile and ever approachable behaviour.<br>

The sunrise at the Tiger Hill is surely one of the best sights one can ever view, and the delight it causes one makes quite up for the early morning toiling one has to go through in order to make in time to grab a spot at the sunrise spot, because this tourist destination is packed all-round the entire year.<br>

<strong>Darjeeling is also the gateway to many other interesting and lesser known hill stations such as<em> Mirik,</em> and several places at Sikkim apart from the main attraction of that state- Gangtok.</strong><br>
